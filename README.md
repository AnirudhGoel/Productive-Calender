# :date: Productive Calendar

A Django based application that functions as a complete planner with features like event management, Google Calendar Sync, weather details, on-screen clock, responsive design and a elegant UI.

## Features

- **Event Management**<br>You can view, create, modify and delete events, all while staying on the same page.
- **Weather info**<br>This calendar automatically displays weather details, including the current temperature, minimum/maximum temperature and rainy/sunny conditions for the current week, all on the home page.
- **Responsive Design**<br>This was one of the major challenges that I faced during the development of this calendar. As the event creation, deletion and modifying was all to be done on the same (home) page, I had to write some intelligent Javascript code to recognise the screen size and place the event (display, add, or modify) box according to the screen size.
- **Elegant UI**<br>Along with providing all the important functionalities, this calendar also has a very elegant UI.
- **Google Calendar Sync (Demo Feature)**<br>Just sign in to your Google account and all the events you create, modify or delete will be synced across both the calenders automatically. This is only a demo feature as this application has no account management.
